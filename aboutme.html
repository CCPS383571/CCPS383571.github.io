        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am working towards getting more organized and stop procrastinating.
          I need to get more organized because I always forget things and lose 
          things, I also procrastinate just about everything. To get more organized 
          I am starting to write things down and making reminders so then I do not 
          forget. I am also making a little schedule every morning so then soon I do
          it naturally. To stop procrastinating I started telling myself  "do this
          now so then you are not rushing when something else comes up". Some short
          terms goal I have are getting better with studying and turning work in on time.</p>
